# Data Cleaning and Analysis: Layoffs Dataset

This repository contains the raw and cleaned versions of a dataset on company layoffs. The project focuses on cleaning and transforming raw data into a structured and analyzable format using SQL, ensuring the dataset is consistent, accurate, and ready for analysis.

## Files in the Repository

- **`layoffs.csv`**: The raw dataset in CSV format containing information about layoffs, such as company details, location, industry, funding stage, and employee layoff numbers.
- **`Data cleaning.sql`**: The SQL script used to clean and transform the raw data. It includes steps for removing duplicates, handling null values, and standardizing the data.

## Dataset Overview

### Raw Data Summary

The raw data contains the following columns:

| Column Name              | Description                               |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `company`                | Name of the company                      |
| `location`               | Company location                         |
| `industry`               | Industry type                            |
| `total_laid_off`         | Number of employees laid off             |
| `percentage_laid_off`    | Percentage of workforce laid off         |
| `date`                   | Date of layoffs                          |
| `stage`                  | Company funding stage                    |
| `country`                | Country of the company                   |
| `funds_raised_millions`  | Funds raised by the company (in millions)|

### Key Issues in Raw Data

- **Duplicates**: 5 duplicate rows were identified.
- **Missing Data**:
  - `total_laid_off`: 740 missing values (~31%).
  - `percentage_laid_off`: 785 missing values (~33%).
  - Minor missing values in `industry`, `date`, `stage`, and `funds_raised_millions`.
- **Formatting Inconsistencies**: Blank spaces and inconsistent text formats in some fields.

## Cleaning Process

The data cleaning process was implemented using SQL and included the following steps:

1. **Duplicate Removal**:
   - Identified duplicates using the `ROW_NUMBER()` function based on critical columns like `company`, `location`, and `industry`.
   - Removed duplicate rows by filtering rows with `row_no > 1`.

2. **Standardization**:
   - Cleaned text formats (e.g., removing trailing spaces, ensuring consistent casing).
   - Verified consistent date formats.

3. **Handling Null Values**:
   - Retained critical rows with missing values but flagged them for further review.
   - Ensured logical consistency (e.g., aligning percentages with total layoffs).

4. **Schema Adjustment**:
   - Dropped unnecessary columns (if applicable).
   - Ensured appropriate data types for each column (e.g., percentages stored as numeric).

## How to Use

1. **Explore the Raw Data**:
   - Open the `layoffs.csv` file to understand its structure and identify data issues.
2. **Run the SQL Script**:
   - Load the raw data into your database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   - Execute the `Data cleaning.sql` script to clean and transform the data.
3. **Analyze the Cleaned Data**:
   - Use the cleaned dataset for further analysis, visualizations, or reporting.
